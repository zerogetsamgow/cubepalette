Description: Cube Group's colour palette uses modern and distinctive tones
    to convey corporate warmth. The Cube Group Green is used in majority,
    bringing maturity and a seriousness when needed. The Cube Group Orange
    adds warmth, livening up layouts and highlighting key information.
    Grey is used as a neutral background colour. Built using the
    'palettes' package, which provides methods for printing, formatting,
    casting and coercion, extraction and updating of components, plotting,
    colour mixing arithmetic, and colour interpolation.
